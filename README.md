> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Machine Learning Projects  


## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflows tailored for machine learning projects. The notebooks provided here demonstrate best practices in data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing, ensuring a strong foundation for building robust predictive models.

## Features

- Interactive and well-documented Jupyter Notebooks
- Step-by-step EDA process:
  - Data loading and inspection
  - Handling missing values and outliers
  - Data visualization (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis)
  - Feature engineering and selection
  - Correlation analysis
- Clean code with comments and markdown explanations
- Ready-to-use templates for your ML datasets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Common data science libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

Install requirements with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PRAVITH10HJ/EDA-for-ML.git
   cd EDA-for-ML
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the notebooks and follow the guided steps.

4. Replace the sample dataset with your own data to adapt the EDA workflow.
